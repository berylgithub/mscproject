This repository contains the souce code for my MSc Project: "For or Against? Assessing the evidence for news headline claims.". The code is written in Python 2.7 and makes use of a number of external libraries, such as pandas and sklearn. To run the code I suggest you:

1. install the anaconda distribution of Python 2.7 from continuum.io, available here: http://continuum.io/downloads 
2. create a new Python virtual environment, by issuing the command: conda create -n XXX anaconda python=2.7 at the command prompt (replace XXX with whatever you want to call the environment, e.g. wfmscproject)
