This repository contains the souce code for my MSc Project: "For or Against? Assessing the evidence for news headline claims.". The code is written in Python 2.7 and makes use of a number of external libraries, such as pandas, sklearn and munk. To run the code from scratch, I suggest:

1. cloning the project in the normal way: git clone https://github.com/willferreira/mscproject.git
2. creating a new folder, called *data*,  in the top directory of the project
3. copying the contents (folders and files) from this dropbox link to the new *data* folder: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9t7fd7xfahb0e1v/AACtdXhZmaTU9QgxZ8jL5tyVa?dl=0
4. installing the anaconda distribution of Python 2.7 from continuum.io, available here: http://continuum.io/downloads 
5. creating a new Python virtual environment, by issuing the command: conda create -n XXX anaconda python=2.7 at the command prompt (replacing XXX with whatever you want to call the environment, e.g. mscproject_py27)
